# Pymaceuticals

Pymaceuticals uses python, pandas, jupyter notebooks, and matplotlib to analyze fictional animal study data for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In this fictional study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The data is being analyzed to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

The analysis to compare the four treatments includes visualizations such as: 
* A scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* A scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* A scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

Highlights of this data analysis are: 

* The use of the Pandas Library and Jupyter Notebook.
* The use of the Matplotlib library.
* A written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Proper labeling of plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, X and Y Axis Limits, etc.
* Error bars on scatter plots that that account for variability between mice. 
* A colorful bar graph that indicates tumor growth as red and tumor reduction as green. The bar graph also includes a label with the percentage change for each bar.
